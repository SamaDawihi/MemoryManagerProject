# MemoryManagerProject
Memory manager project  involve  managing a contiguous region of memory using a fixed size partition scheme.
The project perform three main tasks:
- Allocates memory blocks using one of the three contiguous memory allocation approaches (First-fit, Best-fit, Worst-fit)
- De-allocates memory blocks
- Provides a status report about the current state of memory

# How to Run
1. Open the project with any editor.
2. Start running the program
3. You will be asked to enter number of memory partions

4. Then you have to enter the partion size for each one

5. Then enter the desirable allocation strategy

6. A menue will be displayed to choose the desire task (Allocate,De-Allocate,Generate report, Exit the program):
  - In case you choose Allocate (Option 1), you have to enter the process ID and its size.

  - In case you choose De-Allocate (Option 2), you have to enter the process ID to release.

  - In case you choose Report (Option 3), the program will display adetailed information about regions of free and allocated memory blocks.

  - In case you choose Exit (Option 4), the program will end.
